# File Encoder

This tool is used to convert a wasm chaincode to hex encoded string. The hex encoded string can then be passed as an argument over cli.

- Do ```go build``` to create executable binary
- Execute the binary : ```./file-encoder```
- Pass the file path of .wasm chaincode file
- The hex encoded string will be copied to clipboard and also will be shown at terminal
